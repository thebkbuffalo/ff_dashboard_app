## General Assembly Project 1

<a href="http://boiling-hamlet-9525.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">My app</a> is a Dashboard application geared towards Fantasy Football knowledge.  Although is also applicable to all around football fun knowledge.  The application allows users to select various API's/RSS Feeds that offer up great information on the latest what's happenings in the NFL world.

<a href="http://boiling-hamlet-9525.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">My app</a> was developed by <a href="http://github.com/thebkbuffalo" target="_blank">Evan Berg</a> over the course of a 4 day coding sprint.  All of the application came to fruition after the first 5 weeks of General Assembly's Web Development Intensive course.  Please not that this project, like most is very much an ongoing project and will continue to be worked on over the next many months.
